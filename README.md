# InMind Projects – Robotics Track

This repository contains all my projects completed during the InMind Academy Robotics Track, where I trained in ROS2, Nav2, BehaviorTree.CPP, SLAM, AMCL, Docker, Git, Linux, and more.

## Projects

- **git-assignment** – Practiced Git workflows by creating and merging branches, resolving conflicts, and using pull requests with code reviews.
- **linux-bash-assignment** – Gained hands-on experience with Linux commands, file management, system monitoring, networking tools, and automation using Bash scripting.
- **docker-networking-assignment** – A containerized data producer-consumer setup using Docker Compose.
- **vff_avoidance-assignment** – ROS2-based obstacle avoidance using laser scan data.
- **behaviortree-research-assignment** – A study and design of decision-making architecture in robotics.
- **nav-bt-FinalProject** – Full ROS2 navigation system with SLAM, AMCL, and autonomous recharging.
